# Preliminary Thoughts

## Abstract
Design must facilitate interaction. Interaction points back to design and design back to interaction. How we design a user experience provides information, emotion, and action.

1. I want to help people learn how to think, not to think for them. I realize this might be futile and self-defeating, but I think to maintain my integrity throug the entire process, I would have to keep this in mind. I think this is most important in Christ-following discipleship.
2. I want to facilitate further interaction with the content that allows for: (1) depth into the text, and (2) breadth as it relates to the reader's interaction with their world.
