# Read Me #

**Design Guidelines** is repository of my human interaction guidelines. In my writing, publishing, and blogging these are the design principles that I will come under. These guidelines will provide a framework to build on.

## About Design Guidelines ##

I write because it is my passion. I'm currently working on a book. This repository is an opportunity for me to analyze, navigate and curate my thoughts as I think of designing interaction around content consumption. I want to have a framework in place so that when people interact with content that I create (ie. *digital media* and *print media*) there would be a design in place. I want to think through and plan that interaction.
